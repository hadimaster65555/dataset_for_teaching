# Context

We apply the analysis on a clinical trial in which the efficiency of a preventer inhaler is evaluated in a patient with Asthma. The main outcome (Peakflow) was daily monitored during 2 months (60 days) before and after the beginning of treatment.

The study question is whether the use of preventer inhaler from day 61 has significantly improved the Peakflow during the treatment. In other word, we should make a causal inference about the beneficial effect of treatment on Peakflow.

Data:
- Peakflow: target variable
- SBP: placebo
- Treatment: Before and After treatment flagging
