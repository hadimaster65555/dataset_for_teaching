# Context

In 1980, Kentucky raised its cap on weekly earnings that were covered by worker’s compensation. We want to know if this new policy caused workers to spend more time unemployed. If benefits are not generous enough, then workers could sue companies for on-the-job injuries, while overly generous benefits could cause moral hazard issues and induce workers to be more reckless on the job, or to claim that off-the-job injuries were incurred while at work.

The main outcome variable we care about is log_duration (in the original data as ldurat, but we rename it to be more human readable), or the logged duration (in weeks) of worker’s compensation benefits. We log it because the variable is fairly skewed—most people are unemployed for a few weeks, with some unemployed for a long time. The policy was designed so that the cap increase did not affect low-earnings workers, but did affect high-earnings workers, so we use low-earnings workers as our control group and high-earnings workers as our treatment group.
